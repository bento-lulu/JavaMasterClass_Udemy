# JavaMasterClass_Udemy
Practice code for the Java MasterClass course from Udemy

I did this course to get back on track with Java and learn the new Java Topics introduced in Java 8 (namely lambdas and streams)
The course is super long, but i learned a lot, which is what i wanted

In the code here, there are comments in english, in portuguese(my language), and some code without comments (my apologies). This is just my place to store these codes and share with anyone.
