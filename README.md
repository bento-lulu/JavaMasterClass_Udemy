# JavaMasterClass_Udemy
Practice code for the Java MasterClass course from Udemy

I did this course to get back on track with the new Java Topics, namely Java 8.
The course is super long, but i learned a lot, which is what i wanted

In the code here, there are comments in english, in portuguese(my language), and some code without comments.

This is just my place to store these codes and share with anyone.
